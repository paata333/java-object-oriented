java is new for me and I do not know many thing within them is packages first and biggest mistake was I have changed file and folders name which caused mess and needed really big  time to fix this was reason why had not enough time second main reason was my laptop looks like 4gb ram is not perfect for this program and it caused crashes and slowed procces of  working I thinck approximatly 20 minutes spend on 15 because of this . mainly I used chat gpt for working process
